GoCoin setup:

Sign in then click the little person icon in the top right part of the screen.
Then fill out your details under the Merchant Profile section.
Next go to the preferences/settings page and add your payout addresses (BTC, LTC, etc).
Copy your Merchant ID and click the button to get a new API Key and copy that too.
Use the Merchant ID and API key to configure GoCoin in the BitShop admin area.
The callback secret can be any string you choose as long as it's not predictable.
