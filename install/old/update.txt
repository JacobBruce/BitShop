How to update BitShop (for v0.9.1 to v1.0.6):

1) Make a backup of your existing BitShop files and database.
2) Upload new BitShop files and replace old files (can skip log files).
3) Run the update_db.php script then run the install.php script.
4) Login to the admin area and update your settings (old settings are lost)
5) Change your cron job commands to run the scripts in the "cron" folder.
6) You will have to reapply any customizations you made to BitShop.

/inc/admin/login.inc.php
/inc/admin/tickconfig.inc.php
/inc/pages/status.inc.php
/sci/ajax_hack.php
/sci/callback.php
